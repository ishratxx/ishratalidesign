          <p class="">
            Iâ€™m a graphic designer currently based in Detroit, Michigan, but born and raised in Queens, NY. My love for art started back in third grade, when I couldnâ€™t stop doodling in class. That curiosity grew into a passion, and over the years I explored editing, photography, and paintingâ€”falling in love with every medium along the way. I found my voice through bold colors, distinct imagery, and impactful imagery in design.Â 
          </p>
          <p class="">
            With a BFA in Graphic Design and a BA in Sociology, I strive to create work that is both visually compelling and socially meaningful. Thoughtful craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail are at the heart of everything I create. I specialize in editorial, branding, and illustration and aim to make a lasting impact through design. When Iâ€™m not working, youâ€™ll probably find me eating something delicious, capturing moments on my Kodak, lifting at the gym, sipping green teaâ€”or, letâ€™s be realâ€”sleeping.Â ðŸŒŸ.
