  "For my reinterpretation of the Divergent series book covers, I took an illustrative approach that re-imagines the dystopian world through a more symbolic lens. Rather than focusing on the original photographic visuals, I leaned into layered compositions and minimal color palettes to evoke the internal struggles and themes woven throughout the story. Each cover centers around a single, abstract emblem that subtly references the corresponding faction while also reflecting the protagonist’s personal evolution. ",
  "This project allowed me to blend my love for storytelling and illustration, with a strong emphasis on cohesive layout design and visual hierarchy. I designed the typography to feel both bold and restrained, letting the illustrations take center stage while maintaining clarity and legibility. Together, the covers function as a unified set, but each one stands on its own with a distinct mood and visual rhythm. This reimagining of the Divergent series was not only an exercise in visual reinterpretation but also a chance to explore how illustration can breathe new emotional depth into familiar narratives.",
